        The journey begins with engines, dust, and the adrenaline of motion. <br> Photography first took shape in the
        vibrant world of motorsport — a space where speed and chaos meet precision and focus. <br>
        What started as fascination soon became exploration, a way of capturing energy that exists only for a
        fraction of a second.

    <h2>Rally</h2>
    <table class="rally">
        <tr>
            <th><img src="image/porfolio/Rally/Rally Abeti 2023.jpg" alt="Rally Abeti" ></th>
            <th><img src="image/porfolio/Rally/Rally appeninno 2023.jpg" alt="Rally Appeninno"></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th><img src="image/porfolio/Rally/rally del ciocco 2024.jpg" alt="Rally Ciocco 2024" ></th>
            <th><img src="image/porfolio/Rally/Rally del taro 2024.jpg" alt="Rally del Taro 2024" ></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th><img src="image/porfolio/Rally/Rally del taro 2023.jpg" alt="Rally del Taro 2023" ></th>

        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        The first steps were taken on winding roads and mountain trails, surrounded by the echo of engines and the
        smell of burnt rubber. <br>
        Rally photography demanded instinct — the ability to anticipate movement and frame emotion in the
        middle of dust and noise. <br>
        Every shot carried the unpredictability of the race itself, and in that raw spontaneity, a
        love for imperfection was born.
    </p>


    <h2>Circuits</h2>
    <table class="circuit">

        <tr>
            <th><img src="image/porfolio/Circuit/varano1.jpg" alt="Varano De Melegari"  ></th>
            <th><img src="image/porfolio/Circuit/varano2.jpg" alt="Varano De Melegari"  ></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th><img src="image/porfolio/Circuit/corneto1.jpg" alt="Corneto"  ></th>
            <th><img src="image/porfolio/Circuit/corneto2.jpg" alt="Corneto"  ></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th><img src="image/porfolio/Circuit/sanpolo1.jpg" alt="San Polo Circuit"  ></th>
            <th><img src="image/porfolio/Circuit/sanpolo2.jpg" alt="San Polo Circuit"  >
            </th>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        From the open roads to the controlled geometry of racing circuits, the lens found a different rhythm. <br> Here,
        everything followed a pattern — the precise line of a turn, the symmetry of barriers, the repetition of
        laps. <br>
        It was a space to study composition, timing, and discipline. <br>
        Capturing speed became an art of balance between motion and stillness, chaos and control.
    </p>


    <h2>Landscapes & Nature</h2>
    <table class="nature">
        <tr>
            <th><img src="image/porfolio/Nature/Canossa Castle.jpg" alt="Canossa Castle"  ></th>
            <th><img src="image/porfolio/Nature/Dunmore East1.jpg" alt="Dunmore East" ></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th><img src="image/porfolio/Nature/Dunmore East2.jpg" alt="Dunmore East"  ></th>
            <th><img src="image/porfolio/Nature/Hook Lighthouse.JPEG" alt="Hook Lighthouse"  ></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th><img src="image/porfolio/Nature/Lake of Garda.jpg" alt="Lake of Garda"  ></th>
            <th><img src="image/porfolio/Nature/Vajont1.jpg" alt="Vajont"  ></th>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        Over time, the search for adrenaline gave way to a search for silence. <br> The camera turned toward landscapes,
        where light and stillness replaced noise and speed. Nature became a new teacher — showing patience,
        observation, and the beauty of waiting for the right moment. <br>
        Each photograph captured not motion, but time itself: a horizon at dusk, a mountain wrapped in fog, the calm
        before dawn.
    </p>

    <h2>Street Photography</h2>
    <table class="street">
        <tr>
            <th><img src="image/porfolio/Street/Denmark.jpg" alt="Denmark Lady"  ></th>
            <th><img src="image/porfolio/Street/Reggio Emilia.jpg" alt="Reggio Emilia"  ></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th><img src="image/porfolio/Street/Waterford1.jpg" alt="Waterford"  ></th>
            <th><img src="image/porfolio/Street/Waterford2.jpg" alt="Waterford"  ></th>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        Eventually, the journey found its way into the streets. <br>
        What once was the energy of engines became the rhythm of people — gestures, glances, and fleeting
        interactions that reveal human stories. <br>
        Street photography brought everything together: the instinct learned from rallies, the precision from
        circuits, the attention to light from landscapes. <br>
        Every corner, every shadow, every passerby became a new chance to tell a story.
