        <p>One of Italy's greatest strengths is its regional diversity. <br>
            Each area has its own traditions, dialects, cuisine, and character. <br>
            The north is home to mountains, lakes, and elegant cities, while the south offers sunny coastlines,
            colorful villages, and a strong Mediterranean identity. <br>
            Whether exploring small towns or famous destinations,
