                To me, photography is an art of observation.
                It's about finding something interesting in an ordinary place.`<br>

            <p>
                Born and raised in Italy, I grew up surrounded by light, rhythm, and emotion
                elements<br> that taught me to see beauty in simplicity and sound in silence.

            <p>
                Photography, for me, is a way of translating what I feel into light;<br> music is the rhythm that guides my
                vision and my timing.

            <p>Together, they shape the way I tell stories — honest, imperfect, and full of life.
                <br>This space is where they meet, where sound becomes image and image becomes sound.</p>
