    <h1>My Musical Journey</h1>

    <p>
        Music has always been more than just sound for me <br>
        it's a constant companion, a thread woven through the rhythm of my days. <br>
        My love for music started when I was just eight or nine.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was immediately drawn to the raw energy of rock, metal, and punk,<br> and it wasn't long before I found myself
        behind a drum kit, fascinated by rhythm and beats.<br>
        Bands like <b>Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Police, System of a Down, and Blink-182</b> became my first heroes,<br>
        their music shaping the soundtrack of my childhood.

    <p>
        As I grew, my ears began to wander into new territories. <br>
        By middle school, I discovered Italian rap and trap, and
        artists like <b>Sfera Ebbasta, Tedua, Capo Plaza, and Mostro</b> <br>quickly became part of my everyday life. <br>
        But my curiosity didn't stop there. <br>I began to explore beyond the popular hits, diving deep into <br>the history of
        different genres, eager to understand the stories and cultures behind the music.

    <p>
        Reggae became my next discovery. <br> I immersed myself in its rhythms and subgenres, <br>
        learning about the pioneers who defined it <b>Peter Tosh, Gregory Isaacs, and, of course, Bob Marley.</b> <br>
        Their lyrics told stories of struggle, hope, and life itself, and I found myself analyzing every word, every
        melody.

    <p>
        This journey eventually led me to modern reggae and to my fellow countryman Alborosie,<br> whose music immediately
        captivated me with its honesty, depth, and
        perspective on life. <br>
        My exploration continued into the world of Italian rap and hip-hop,<br> tracing its roots and evolution across the
        country.

    <br>
    <p>
        I discovered artists like Neffa, Fabri Fibra, Club Dogo, Mondo Marcio, and Bassi Maestro <br>whose lyrics
        painted vivid portraits of lives, places, and eras <br>I hadn't experienced firsthand.  Digging deeper, <br>I found
        the voices of <b>Primo Brown, Noyz Narcos, Inoki, Nitro, and Mostro,</b> each bringing a new layer of understanding and
        inspiration.

    <p>
        Among all of them, one artist stands out as having shaped me the most: Salmo. <br> His music — raw, honest,
        sometimes
        intense — has accompanied me through some of the most important moments of my life. <br> His lyrics have
        challenged me,
        guided me, and even helped me make some of the biggest decisions I've ever faced.

            Music, for me, is never just background noise. <br> It's a teacher, a mirror, a companion. <br>
            Each rhythm I follow, each lyric I study, and each beat I feel is part of a lifelong journey <br> one that
            continues to shape who I am and how I see the world.
